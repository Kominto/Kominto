# Hoi!
I'm Koko, an IT student and aspiring game dev.
Linux user 'till the end!
Mainly using C++ and Python for now.

## Current Projects
* Kinoko, a multi-purpose discord bot (which only does one thing for now, not very multi-purpose eh)
* A small game using SDL2 and C++

## Future plans
* Probably learning Rust
* Understanding how the hell does OpenGl works
* More games
