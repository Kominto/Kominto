# Hi!

## About me
I'm a french IT student, and aspiring game developer (video games are basically my entire life). 

Daily Linux user, currently running Arch and AwesomeWM (loving both)

I mainly code in C++ and Python, and have some knowledge of PHP, SQL, Lua and Java as well.

## Current Projects
* Kinoko, a multi-purpose discord bot
* A small game using SDL2 and C++

## Future plans
* Probably learning Rust
* Understanding how the heck does OpenGl works
* More games
