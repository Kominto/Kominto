# Hi!

## About me
I'm a french IT student, and aspiring game developer (video games are basically my entire life). 

Daily Linux user, bless Arch!

I mainly code in C++ and Python, and have some knowledge of PHP, SQL and Java.

## Current Projects
* Kinoko, a multi-purpose discord bot
* A small game using SDL2 and C++

## Future plans

* More games
